The application will render different images to the screen. Each image will listen for click events.

The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score will be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffles themselves in a random order.

Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.
